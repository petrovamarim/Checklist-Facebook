# Checklist-Facebook
I was excited to see your job listing for the Junior QA Engineer position. Currently I’m at the beginning of my career, but I have strong intention to become a highly-qualified specialist. My previous experience as a sales manager in a travel company enhanced my communicative and administrative skills and eventually led to be appointed in charge of the best-selling destination (Spain): within 3 years, the company gained tour-operating license and increased from 10 to 120 «hard block» seats per week, company profit increased by 25%. 
I give meticulous attention to detail and have a strong work ethic (due to my double check of clients documents I prevent further issues with non-refundable airline tickets and hotel reservation for corporate clients).
